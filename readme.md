# Timecard

*A time-tracking app for Windows Phone 7*

## What?

I got sick of tracking my working hours when at work in late 2011. I told a friend I'd come back the next day with an app that did it for me.

I polished it up a bit over the next couple of weeks, and put it on the Windows Phone Marketplace.
